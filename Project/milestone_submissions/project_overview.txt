4. Application Name
	BookWyrm

5. Application Description
	A website/application that allows users to search a library of books, check off favorite categories/genres, and get recommended other books based on their preferences. 
	This works by having various users apply tags to books they find interesting based on Genre, Author, or even how various other websites rate the book. 
	These tags are intended to be user definable, and stored over the course of a week.

	Our end goal is to provide a website that provides a more reliable experience in helping prospective readers find something that suits their fancy. 
	All too often most critical websites only provide a number as their final conclusion on a book. 
	This is unreliable, and leads to most books and the stories they contain being tossed aside.

	Vision statement: For Readers seeking their personal story.
